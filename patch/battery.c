/* M1+ Music Battery Percentage: the fuel gauge's exact charge, as a number beside the battery outline (docs/modules/battery.md "The percentage").
 *
 * Copyright (c) 2026 Xin. MIT licence (see LICENSE).
 *
 * Stock never reads the AXP2101 gauge: get_battery_capacity (0x4e6dd8) buckets the battery voltage into 0/20/40/60/80/100 (another table, and a +10 animation, while
 * charging) and leaves the result in the global power_capacity (0xa059ec), which show_sysbar_face (0x544b48, the status bar's 1 s timer) and the pull-down's face read
 * for the fill; the return value is dropped there. The one hook is the call-site word `jalr get_battery_capacity` at 0x5450f8 in show_sysbar_face, now `jal bp_capacity`.
 * bp_capacity runs stock's function first, and then, only while Settings > Home Screen > Battery Percentage is on and the kill switch /mnt/mmc/m1plus-off is absent and
 * /sys/class/power_supply/battery/capacity reads a plain integer 0..100, stores that percentage in power_capacity (so the fill, the charging picture's fill and the
 * pull-down's bar use the real level, charging included) and shows "N%" in the label pod_pct that sits left of the outline (its twin pod_pct_dd in the pull-down's bar).
 * At BP_LOW (5) percent or less on battery (and when stock's own bucket is 0) the stored value is 0, which is how stock's own test shows the red bar_lowpower (battery.md "Other readers").
 * In every other case the stock value stays and the labels are hidden (visible and sensitive off). The icon pictures stay stock's (charging, low).
 *
 * The right icon group lays its visible children out right-aligned, so the label (the group's last child but the Screenshot camera, hidden in the asset) makes the icons
 * to its left move aside by its width; the width follows the text (BP_W2 .. BP_W4, measured at build time), and a change of it asks the group to lay out again.
 *
 * Cost: one access (the kill switch), and, with the setting on, one open / read / close of a 4 byte file and a lookup in the small status bar tree per second; the setting
 * is cached (read at the first tick, kept by the Settings switch). Not on the boot path (tools/reach.py), but the first call comes with the status bar window at UI start, so with the setting off (the default) it adds only stock's own call, the access and the cached flag.
