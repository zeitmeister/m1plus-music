/* M1+ Music Albums: the library's albums as a grid of covers or as a list, two modes of one page.
 *
 * Copyright (c) 2026 Xin. MIT licence (see LICENSE).
 *
 * One page, ui/m1plus_albums.bin: the navbar (Back, "Albums", Cover Flow, the mode toggle, Now Playing) over a stock list, list_view >
 * scroll_view (albums_scrollview), exactly the structure of the library lists, whose ONE child is a custom view, view_grid, that paints the
 * albums itself in its own EVT_AFTER_PAINT, as the Recently Played shelf of the menu does (patch/recent.c). There is no widget per album: a
 * library of any size costs the album deque (the stock list, copied as Cover Flow copies it) and a small ring of decoded covers. The stock
 * scroll_view does the scrolling: the drag, the fling and its animation, the catch of a coasting list (patch/scroll.c), the clamp.
 *
 *   grid mode  GRID_COLS (2) columns of GRID_COVER (144) px covers, GRID_GAP px apart, a one-line album and a
 *              one-line artist under each (two text styles taken from the hidden labels label_grid_title and
 *              label_grid_sub); (patch/offsets.inc); row r starts GRID_ROW_GAP + r * PITCH px down the content.
 *   list mode  LIST_ROW_H px rows: a LIST_ART px cover, the album and the artist (two sizes and colours, taken
 *              from two hidden labels of the page, label_row_title and label_row_sub, with
 *              widget_prepare_text_style), a hairline under each row, the row under the finger filled LIST_PRESS.
 *   content    view_grid is as high as the whole content (grid: GRID_ROW_GAP + rows * PITCH, list: count * LIST_ROW_H) and the scroll_view's
 *              virtual_h is set to match (the list_view layouter sums its children's heights into it too); the scroll_view shows it through its
 *              GRID_VIEW_H window at yoffset. The paint moves the canvas origin down by yoffset, so what it draws is in window coordinates (the
 *              top of the window is 0) and only what intersects [0, GRID_VIEW_H) is drawn: a cover with canvas_draw_image (clipped by hand to
 *              the window; the scroll_view also sets the canvas clip to its rectangle), text with canvas_draw_text_in_rect, only when it lies
 *              wholly inside the window.
 *   tiles      GRID_TILES (12) entries. A tile is the album's cover reduced from the Cover Flow cache file (168 px,
 *              box filter) to the mode's cover size (the finished bitmap is kept, not the JPEG). PAINT NEVER DECODES:
 *              it draws the resident tiles and the placeholder for the rest. A page-owned timer (al_on_load, armed
 *              when the view moves or a mode starts, ended when nothing is left to load, removed with the page)
 *              decodes ONE cover per 16 ms tick: the missing cell nearest the middle of the view first (the cells in
 *              view before any other), then the next AL_AHEAD rows in the scroll direction. A tile in that window
 *              is never replaced; the rest of the ring (at least two tiles) is the history, least recently used
 *              replaced, so a reversal finds what it just left. Texts are converted to wide chars with the tile's
 *              record and cut to their width with an ellipsis (measured with the canvas' own font, in the text's own
 *              style) the first time they are drawn.
 *              The loader decodes nothing while the scroll_view is moving (a finger dragging it, or its scroll animator running): a decode
 *              is a few ms on the UI thread and the next touch would wait behind it. Meanwhile it only polls (a compare per tick), and the
 *              scroll events (EVT_SCROLL, the scroll end) re-arm it.
 *              Memory: GRID_TILES (12) bitmaps of at most GRID_COVER^2 * 4 (81 KB) plus one for the placeholder
 *              = 1.08 MB, whatever the library; a decode also holds the 168 px source (113 KB) for its duration.
 *   art        the cover cache (patch/covercache.c); a missing or empty cache file shows the stock placeholder disc
 *              (p_default). Missing files are built in the background by the shared worker (see "The background cache
 *              build" below); the tiles that found no file try again as the worker advances.
 *   touch      the scroll_view's: a drag scrolls, a release flings, a touch on a coasting list stops it and presses nothing. The content view
 *              only sees the pointer events the scroll_view passes on, as the shelf does: DOWN remembers the cell or row under the finger (the
 *              list mode fills the row LIST_PRESS), ABORT (the scroll_view took the gesture as a drag) forgets it, and a release closer than
 *              AL_TAP_PX (the scroll_view's own drag threshold) to the press on both axes, on the same cell or row, opens the stock album
 *              page as Cover Flow does (cc_open_album). Coordinates go through widget_to_local, which includes the scroll offset.
 *
 * The mode toggle: the navbar button switches in place (no window opens or closes): the tiles are dropped, the
 * content is resized and the scroll keeps the first album in view, the button shows the glyph of the other mode, and the choice is persisted
 * (ALBUMS_FILE, written as the Start-in setting is). The menu's Albums row opens the page in the saved mode; if
 * the page cannot open it falls back to the stock Albums list through the Home dispatcher. No stock function is
 * hooked; everything runs from this page's widgets and timers.
